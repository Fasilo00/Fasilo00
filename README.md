    <h1>Is my story have something in the world</h1>
    <p1 style="color: olive; font-size: 20px; font-family: times new roman;">
        I'm fasil who was born in Africa, Ethiopia ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¹.
        So being in Ethiopia is the start of the world for me. It's 2 to 0, with the world at 2 and me at zero.
        To change that 2 to 2 or 2 to 3, I need to work harder than anyone.

    <h2>Some experiences I've had</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p>My first try of coding by myself was on May 23, 2023, at 9:30 PM.</p></li>
        <li>My first crush's name was Kalkidan, but I only loved her and she didn't feel the same.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Kalkidan was my first crush, and my heart was locked for 5 years.</li>
            <li>But in university, I felt the same way for only one girl.</li>
            <li>Her name is Meron, and I still have those feelings.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Another thing is that I am not good at making friends.</li>
    </ul>
